Recipe Sharing App - Backend
This repository contains the backend code for a recipe-sharing web application. 
This backend is built using Spring Boot and provides RESTful APIs for managing recipes, users, and interactions.

Features
User Authentication & Authorization:
Secure user registration, login, and password management.
Role-based access control (e.g., user, admin) to protect sensitive data.
Recipe Management:
Create, read, update, and delete recipes.
Upload and store recipe images.
Categorize recipes (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner).
Allow users to rate and review recipes.
User Profiles:
User accounts with basic information (name, email, etc.).
Ability to follow other users and view their recipes.
Option to create and manage personal recipe collections.
Search & Filtering:
Search recipes by keywords, ingredients, or categories.
Filter recipes based on dietary restrictions (e.g., vegan, gluten-free).
Technologies
Spring Boot: A powerful framework for building Java applications.
Spring Data JPA: Simplifies data access using JPA (Java Persistence API).
Spring Security: Handles authentication, authorization, and user management.
MySQL (or other database): Stores application data (users, recipes, etc.).
JWT (JSON Web Token): Used for secure authentication and authorization.
Lombok: Reduces boilerplate code with annotations.
